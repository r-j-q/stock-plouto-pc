                    forgoes participation in any increase in the stock price above the call exercise price and continues
                    to bear the downside risk of stock ownership if the stock price decreases more than the premium
                    received. Because of the importance of tax considerations to all options transactions, the investor
                    considering options should consult their tax advisor as to how taxes affect the outcome of each
                    options strategy. Commissions and other costs may be a significant factor. An options investor may
                    lose the entire amount of their investment in a relatively short period of time.</br>
                    Article 16. An option holder runs the risk of losing the entire paid for the option in a relatively
                    short period of time. The risk reflects the nature of an option as a wasting asset which becomes
                    worthless when it expires. An option holder who neither sells her option in the secondary market nor
                    exercises it prior to its expiration will necessarily lose her entire investment in the option.</br>
                    Article 17. The fact that options become valueless upon expiration means that an option holder must
                    not only be right about the direction of an anticipated price change in the underlying interest, but
                    she must also be right about when the price change will occur. If the price of the underlying
                    interest does not change in the anticipated direction before the option expires to an extent
                    sufficient to cover the cost of the option, the investor may loss all or a significant part of her
                    investment in the option. This contrasts with an investor who purchases the underlying interest
                    directly and may continue to hold her investment, notwithstanding its failure to change in price as
                    anticipated, in the hope of waiting out an adverse price move and eventually realizing a
                    profit.</br>
                    Article 18. The significance of this risk to an option holder depends in large part upon the extent
                    to which she utilizes the leverage of options to control a large quantity of the underlying interest
                    than she could have purchased directly with the same investment amount.</br>
                    Article 19.The more an option is out of the money and the shorter the remaining time to expiration,
                    the greater the risk that an option holder will lose all or part of the investment in the
                    option.</br>
                    Article 20. The exercise provisions of an option may create certain risks for the option holders. If
                    the option does not have an automatic feature, a holder who wishes to exercise must assure that
                    action is taken in a timely manner.</br>
                    Article 21. The courts, the SEC, another regulatory agency, OCC, or the options markets may impose
                    exercise restrictions. OCC and the options markets have the authority to restrict the exercise of
                    options at certain times in specified circumstances.</br>
                    Article 22. If you are under the age of 18, you are not allowed to use our services. We do not
                    knowingly collect, maintain or sell information about minors under the age of 18.</br>
